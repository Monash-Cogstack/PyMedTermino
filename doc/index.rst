Welcome to PyMedTermino's documentation!
========================================
PyMedTermino (Medical Terminologies for Python) is a Python module for easy access to the main medical
terminologies in Python, including SNOMED CT, ICD10, MedDRA, CDF, UMLS and VCM icons. PyMedTermino has been designed
for "batch" access to terminologies; it is *not* a terminology browser.
SNOMED CT, ICD10 and UMLS data are not included (because they are not freely redistribuable) but they
can be downloaded in XML format (see :doc:`tuto_en` for links).
PyMedTermino has been described in the following scientific article
(please cite it if you use PyMedTermino !):
